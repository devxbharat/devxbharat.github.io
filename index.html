        <h2>Foster collaboration and discuss ideas among developers and build an open-source tech culture for India.</h2>
        <section>
            <h2>Why Tech Culture Matters</h2>
            <p>India has an abundance of talented software engineers. However, despite producing a significant number of engineering graduates, the proportion of pure-tech products being built relative to other countries is quite small. The issue isn't a lack of talent but a lack of a thriving tech culture and the cultivation of ideas, which is what is needed for more innovative tech products.</p>
            <p>For instance, tech talks and meetups in even cities like Bangalore often fail to attract significant attention unless sponsored by a corporate. In Delhi NCR, despite being a hub for major companies like Google, Microsoft, Zomato, and several HFT firms, the tech scene remains relatively dormant, limiting knowledge sharing.</p>
            <p>As an engineer, I have found that personal growth in tech skills often comes from individual efforts rather than company initiatives. Collaboration among individuals leads to a compounding of skills. While pair-programming might not be universally favoured, it often results in learning something new. Additionally, the lack of quality Indian tech blogs and the decline of hackathon culture post-college highlights why India needs its own Maker movement, and the timing couldn't be more perfect as the current tech landscape in India is ripe for transformation.</p>

            <h2>Why Open Source Matters</h2>
            <p>JusPay, Hasura, Postman, Zerodha, Hoppscotch, CRED, BrowserStack and many other Indian Companies are examples of firms contributing to the open-source landscape. Their contributions, such as CRED's open-sourced front-end and design components library, Zerodha's listmonk, Juspay's Hyperswitch, etc. help in accelerating learning, but we need more contributors. By embracing open source, we can create a culture of sharing and collaboration that will propel India to the hacker culture.</p>
            <p>India's tech landscape has been transformed by innovations like UPI (Unified Payments Interface) from NPCI and government initiatives such as API Setu. These developments showcase India's readiness to embrace technology and highlight the immense potential for open-source contributions. By creating open-source tools and applications that leverage these APIs, we can establish a foundation for further innovation, particularly in sectors like fintech and information accessibility.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the open-source model can be extended to other fields such as IoT, LLMs, embedded systems, operating systems, etc. A thriving open-source community in these areas could catalyze innovation across various sectors, reducing friction towards further developments.</p>

            <h2>Why devbharat Matters</h2>
            <p>Great ideas rarely emerge in isolation. devbharat aims to create a community for tech discussions and collaboration tailored to the Indian context. Existing platforms often lack the moderation and quality discussions needed for meaningful engagement.</p>
            <p>While prestigious institutions like IIT offer networking benefits, talented individuals from less renowned colleges often lack these opportunities. devbharat aims to bridge this gap by fostering an environment where engineers can freely share ideas and work together on projects.</p>
            <p>At their core, engineers want to create without the pressures of management. Fuck the MBA folks (a lot of them), forget VCs, build your shit. The goal is to attract curious minds interested in contributing to and promoting tech culture in India.</p>

            <h2>git init devbharat</h2>
            <p>If the reader is interested, please drop me a mail at <a href="mailto:hello@devbharat.org">hello@devbharat.org</a> to get added to the mailing list.</p>
            <p>In the coming days, I'll set up a self-hosted Discourse forum or a similar platform to facilitate discussions and project collaborations. Your ideas, suggestions, and feedback are not just welcome â€“ they're essential as we build this community together.</p>
            <p>Thanks!</p>
